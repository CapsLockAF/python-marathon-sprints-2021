# Define a class Employee. In the class Employee implement the instance
# attributes as firstname, lastname and salary.
#
# Create the method from_string() which parses a string containing these
# attributes and assigns them to the correct properties.
# Properties will be separated by a dash.
#
# Examples:
# emp1 = Employee("Mary", "Sue", 60000)
# emp2 = Employee.from_string("John-Smith-55000")
# emp1.firstname ➞ "Mary"
# emp1.salary ➞ 60000
# emp2.firstname ➞ "John

    def __init__(self, firstname, lastname, salary):
        self.firstname = firstname
        self.lastname = lastname
        self.salary = salary

    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, s):
        firstname, lastname, salary = (x for x in s.split("-"))
        return cls(firstname, lastname, salary)
